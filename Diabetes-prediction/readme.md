# Diabetes Prediction


This mini project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on medical parameters using machine learning.  
It was inspired by (https://youtu.be/xUE7SjVx9bQ) and implemented independently for learning purposes.

## 🔍 Overview
- **Task:** Binary Classification (Diabetes: Yes/No)  
- **Dataset:** Pima Indians Diabetes dataset (CSV included)  
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression (baseline), can be extended to SVM, Random Forest, etc.  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  

---

## 📊 Steps
1. Load and inspect the dataset  
2. Handle missing values (if any)  
3. Split data into training and test sets  
4. Train a Logistic Regression model  
5. Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve  
6. Make predictions for new input data

## 📈 Results
- Successfully trained a model to classify diabetes  
- Visualized feature distributions and regression performance  
- Achieved **[your accuracy]%** accuracy on the test dataset
